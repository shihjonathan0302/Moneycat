# **MoneyCat**
### An intuitive app for university students to track their expenses, analyze spending habits, and improve financial decision-making.

## Motivation

### 1. Our Investigation
Our survey of college students revealed two critical insights:
1. **Do students track their spending?**
   - Approximately **46.7% of students track their spending**, while **53.3% do not**.

2. **Does tracking spending change financial habits?**
   - Among those who do track their spending, only **51% successfully changed their financial habits**, while **49% did not**.

These results show that while many students try to track their spending, doing so does not necessarily lead to meaningful changes in their financial habits.

### 2. Questions to Current Apps
Despite the availability of numerous expense tracking apps, several questions remain unanswered:
- **Does tracking expenses really help us save money?**
- **How can expense tracking become a more practical tool for college students, especially given the increasing financial pressure they face?**
- Many existing apps focus on making expense tracking **fun** rather than **effective**, prioritizing gamified features over genuinely helping users save money.

### 3. Our Aim
To address these gaps, our goal is to create an app that emphasizes **practicality and effectiveness**. MoneyCat is designed with three main functions to help students not only track their expenses but also make better financial decisions:

1. **Need vs. Want Categorization**  
   - Students can identify whether their expenses are necessities or discretionary, allowing for clearer financial planning.

2. **KANO Analysis**  
   - A unique feature that helps users analyze and rate their expenses based on their impact on satisfaction and financial goals.

3. **Personalized Spending Suggestions**  
   - Based on their spending patterns, users receive actionable advice to help them save money and make informed financial choices.
